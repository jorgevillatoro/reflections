What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
it creates a hidden folder with the metadata about the files that are in the folder.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is where we add the files that we would like to save in one of our commits.
The repository is the unique collections fo files already saved in our working directory.
The value it offers is the great flexibility to control what we would like to save in one comitt

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
since we are adding the files we want to the staging area first before the commit we have the control to make sure that there is only one logical change per commit.
at the same time we can add and remove from the staging area.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
they help because they create a different logical extension of our code perhaps like the case when we have the same code but in a different language making it equivalent but different at the same time.
