When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
I beleive I would want to use it when I would need to work in collaborations with others or just to have my work accesible from anywhere.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
to avoid conflicts with code that we may no be familiar with spcially if some else has modified the code.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks are meant to be used when we would like to have a copy of a repository from someonelse giving them credit, adding more into our own version of it because it will stay in githubs server. Thats also a way to have access to it from anywhere.

Clones of code are a copy we make without necessarily maintainig who made the code, we can have local clones and the clones we can make from a repository.
Branches are made from a clone to create a seperate version of an existing code that can be further developed into something slightly or vastly different but from the same origin.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
It allows for easy management of our copy online since we can remember the state our online state is. we can work locally and modify the content accordingly to the last current state of our files.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
when it comes to collaboration I would say there wasn't a better approach, my initial thinking leads to believe that managed servers with manually made backup of files would a way to go without git or github and that would be hard but it would be a way to collaborate. Git and Github made things easier at the need of collaboration it gives more control, separete access to the same code without breaking no ones elses code.
