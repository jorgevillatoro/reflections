When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
I beleive I would want to use it when I would need to work in collaborations with others or just to have my work accesible from anywhere.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
to avoid conflicts with code that we may no be familiar with spcially if some else has modified the code.
